In this talk, I will share how NiceDay helps therapists to provide more effective therapy using Measurement-Based Care while empowering clients to take ownership of their treatment. Furthermore, I will share how our privacy-aware data analytics suite fuels care organisations to optimise their care process. Finally, I will share some key learnings from scaling our service to thousands of therapists across Dutch public healthcare.
