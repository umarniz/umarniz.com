Involved in designing and conceptualizing the product from day 1, my role has been to oversee all technical decisions and manage the product team. Led a team of 25+ engineers to build the product and built the vision for the service in close coordination with the CEO and product owners through the years.

I have overseen the management of the company including a transition to a new CEO and have been involved in the general management of the entire company.

Having grown the company from a startup to scale-up, I have been end responsible for all product & tech teams including HR/recruiting, compliance (ISO 27001/NEN 7510) and end-to-end product and technical development.

The product is used by a significant number of the therapists in the Netherlands and has seen tens of thousands of monthly active users.
