Hired as an Android engineer I was involved in helping improve some core functionality which involved Java development and improving android layouts. I was also involved in improving the underlying C++ logic that was used by the app to perform context aware messaging and coaching in the app. I was also involved

I initiated several high level chores in improving the build pipeline for the product using [Jenkins to perform automated static analysis with Infer](/static-analysis-build-server-for-android-with-jenkins-using-docker/) and [perform automated tests](/android-test-driven-development/) for both iOS and Android.

I was later involved in improving the infrastructure supporting this product and moved the backend components for it to Docker. Finally to improve the underlying vision of context aware messaging, I created a new service to send context aware messages to client applications with remote programmable logic.
