Pathway Genomics partnered with IBM to showcase the power of watson in healthcare. For this, a healthcare assistant was created for iOS and Android that takes data from multiple health sources and gives you suggestions to improve your health. The app was showcased at CES 2016 and received significant press coverage.

For this project, I first created a GLSL based visual avatar (the slow moving orb) that reacts to actions performed in the app. This was further optimized and then I developed the full iOS application myself while helping an engineer with whom I developed the android application.

* Custom caching and optimizations to reduce network usage
* Developed in swift 2.0 with custom views and GLSL components built using objective-c
* Created the avatar using GLSL based on creative brief
* Push Notifications, Health Kit, Fitbit, GPS and Maps components

### Android (Java)
* Co-developed with another developer
* Responsible for all screens except the main navigation screen
* Extended Async-HTTP library for backend API and used custom caching methods
* Custom GLSL renderer using the same shader as created for iOS
* Google Fit, Fitbit, GPS and Maps components
