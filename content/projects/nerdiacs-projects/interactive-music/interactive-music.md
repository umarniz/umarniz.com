Combining my love for art, music and technology, this demo showcases the beauty of GPU particles reacting to the music. To take this interaction a step further for experiential marketing, a Microsoft Kinect was placed which would cause the particles to form a text when someone danced interacted with the visuals.

## Summary

* Sole Programmer responsible for end to end development
* GPU particles with multiple predefined configurations
* FFT of currently playing sound sample drives particle parameters
* Connected to Kinect with a hidden skeletal model
* Skeletal model interacts with particles to disturb flow
* Spline following particles to form any custom text
