Since the rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been considerable anxiety about AI taking over jobs—a recurring fear whenever transformative technology emerges. The potential impact of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is indeed profound. However, I recently came across a surprising fact that challenges the prevailing narrative. Despite ChatGPT being available for 1.5 years by the end of 2023, there are approximately 1.2 job vacancies per unemployed person in developed countries [(source)](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/help-wanted-charting-the-challenge-of-tight-labor-markets-in-advanced-economies).

In other words, there are more jobs than people seeking them.

The reasons for this are complex. Factors range from the types of jobs available to historically low unemployment rates, enabling people to be more selective in their job choices. But one crucial aspect of this equation is the growing reluctance of people to work.

In a world increasingly aware of its challenges, many are questioning the value of contributing to a system they see as destructive and unsustainable. Why should we work to perpetuate a capitalistic system that seems to hasten the end of human existence?

This low motivation to work, coupled with a heightened moral awareness, is gnawing at us from within. We see this in the rising rates of burnout, especially in advanced economies. Consider the educated consultant writing reports to help banks earn more money or the creative professional who once relished the challenge of producing high-budget videos, only to be struck by the futility of yet another shampoo ad.

> In a world full of moral awareness, purpose is the unicorn.

As we advance towards a future where the efficiency of human effort increases exponentially, we will be forced to rethink many of the norms we take for granted today. There has been extensive discussion on this topic, and ideas like [Universal Basic Income](https://www.notion.so/Purpose-and-the-future-of-work-7debc8bfada94019ba25fa0dca673b76?pvs=21) are currently among the most promising solutions, supported by people across the political spectrum.

As society gradually adapts to this new economy, ventures that prioritize purpose over profit will have an enormous potential to lead the market.

We are already facing a [significant talent shortage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2024/02/12/yes-the-talent-shortage-is-real-what-you-must-know-to-attract-and-retain/), and this problem will only intensify. While the world invests more money into solving tomorrow's problems, finding people willing to take up the challenge and work on these issues is becoming increasingly difficult.

We need experts to address the most pressing problems of the future, but in a world devoid of purpose, many experts are left pondering, "Why bother working full-time? Why work hard when it only seems to make the rich richer?"

This presents a prime opportunity to build a new kind of venture—one that prioritizes purpose over profit. Ventures that cap returns on investment and reinvest excess revenue into solving the problems they aim to address.

I don't claim to have all the answers, but having spent the last eight years helping to build NiceDay, a mental health venture focused on prioritizing purpose over profit, I have seen firsthand the immense value of purpose and learned key lessons in building such ventures.

Building a purpose-driven company allowed us to attract top talent, even without the resources of big tech or e-commerce giants. Purpose simplified motivation within the company, as our goal was clear: to help therapists treat more people. It also simplified our sales efforts, as the underlying social issue was easy to explain.

While the outcome didn't achieve the massive global impact I had hoped for, the experience showed me how much simpler and more effective it is to build a company when purpose comes first.

To support the creation of purpose-driven ventures, there is already significant traction behind legal concepts like [Steward Ownership](https://purpose-economy.org/en/whats-steward-ownership/), which provides a legal framework to ensure that companies stay true to their mission.

Many inspiring companies are exploring Steward Ownership models, from large clothing brands like [Patagonia](https://medium.com/@purpose_network/the-patagonia-structure-in-the-context-of-steward-ownership-e9db3d260dc6) to forward-thinking search engines like [Ecosia](https://purpose-economy.org/en/companies/ecosia/) that have been challenging Google's monopoly since 2009.

By reinvesting excess revenue into addressing social issues—whether through donations to restore ecosystems or building grassroots movements in developing countries within the same sector—we can bridge the gap between profit-first and non-profit companies.

This blog post is a collection of thoughts I've been developing over the years, with the intention of eventually creating a comprehensive framework. But for now, I wanted to share these ideas in the hope that others will think along the same lines.

If you found this topic interesting, feel free to reach out! Having worked at the intersection of tech and entrepreneurship with a strong drive for social impact, I'm always open to discussing potential collaborations to make a bigger impact together.
