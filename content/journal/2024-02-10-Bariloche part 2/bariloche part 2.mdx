Being back in Bariloche the last few days have gone by like a blur. Hanging out with people I already know for the last weeks or met recently but have the same energy with, life has become cozy. Things are happening with little energy spent to make them happen but each day being full, rich and joyful. It feels great to be content.

My mind is enjoying this sensation of joy, relaxation and continuously doing something I enjoy which can be cycling, hiking, climbing, standup paddle board or anything else that keeps me active in the great outdoors.

Random beautiful encounters continue to happen, which can be a beautiful present from a stranger I shared the Dahl I cooked with or a ride back home from a 66 year old climber who is climbing at a level I might never be able to climb (8A sport climbing).

Everyday I am experiencing more of the beautiful side of human nature. These experiences arenâ€™t happening because everyone is travelling and in a happy place, on the contrary the strongest impact is left by those who are working and living their lives as they normally would but still are able to share the beauty of their lives with a strange traveller like me.

Life is truly a self fulfilling prophecy. You get exactly what you think life truly is. If you live with the belief that most people are bad by default you become hesitant to help strangers and close yourself from unnecessary contact. This makes strangers also shy away from you hence alienating them from you and further reinforcing your belief that strangers are strange. 

In turn if you believe most people are good, you become more open and willing to help. Which makes them realise less hesitant to reach out to you and do more for you, hence further reinforcing your belief that most people are good. 

The concept of a self fulfilling prophecy is incredible and something that took me a long time to truly understand the power of in my work, relationships and life as a whole.

If you believe someone is going to be a bad at something, you will start micro-managing them and they will become more dependant and frustrated by their lack of learning which further re-informed your belief. Same goes for relationships, if you believe you canâ€™t trust your partner your very actions will result in them acting more exactly in the way that adds distrust.

I have a deep unwavering belief that most people are good. As I travel and meet more people, this belief keeps getting reinforced with every contact. This doesnâ€™t mean that I havenâ€™t come across bad people, just that they havenâ€™t affected me enough to change my core belief of the good in humanity.

I move forward a day at a time enjoying this state of being content and tackling questions of what I might end up doing next. The trail is still wild and messy as I traverse this unknown path in my life but the state I am in is of absolute calm.
