Iâ€™ve spent the last days with friends and family in Hyderabad and Karachi. Days have been slow as the heat has been too strong for me. Temperatures crossing 40 celsius on a daily basis with humidity making it feel like higher than 46 celsius. Itâ€™s very hard to think or be productive in this weather for me.

As I say goodbyes to friends and family the reality of me going back to the Netherlands is becoming more real for myself. I am lost for words but inside me my emotions and priorities are pretty clear. Itâ€™s time to build.
