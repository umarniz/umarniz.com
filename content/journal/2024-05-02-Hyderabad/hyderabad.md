Itâ€™s great to see my parents and family. Very few things replace the feeling of a hug from your parents when you grow older so I cherish it while I can. I only get the chance to see them once every year or two so itâ€™s very clear to see how they age making me conscious of my own mortality.

It feels strange to be back in Hyderabad this time. I feel like a world traveller which is weird as I have been here after having travelled around Europe and Asia. I guess South America is just very different and remote to imagine for most people here.

The summer heat is insane, crossing 46 Celsius. I feel trapped in my own house as itâ€™s not possible to leave. The lack of movement and intellectual effort is making me restless but I am embracing the time I have here.

The food is incredible as always and I am here for the first time in 8 years right in time for mango season so I canâ€™t really complain.

The gym is keeping me sane for now as there is very little physical movement to be done in this heat.
