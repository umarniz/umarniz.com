I donâ€™t understand how I am feeling, or maybe  I do but I donâ€™t want to realise what these feelings mean. The last weeks have been a dream. Just a blurred memory with tons of adventure, party and a feeling of having fun each and every second.

For now I know I have been beyond content the last several weeks, to an extent that gives life profound purpose and adventure. From seeing some climbing friends again in Santiago to partying in Mendoza to camping in the absolute wilderness. Life has been just complete. I am happy to have experienced this and will cherish these memories for ever.
