The last few weeks have been a complete change of gear. From being out in nature, climbing, hiking and spending most of my time in the great outdoors, I have spent the last 2 weeks mostly indoors behind a computer.

Pondering and researching over many different problems I aim to solve in the coming years of my life. Itâ€™s such a strange feeling to be behind the computer after such a break. A few hours of looking at the screen strains my eyes and not moving at all for hours on end is taking some getting used to.

I have formed a fantastic rhythm these days of working long hours, reading outdoors for several hours and working out in the gym. It took some time to find the discipline and motivation to spend long focussed hours on a single problem but I think I am getting there. There is so much that needs to be improved in the world we live in and I can definitely see myself playing a role in making the future I see to become a reality.

The adventures in the last months have made me realise the importance of nature around me but I donâ€™t see myself only staying outdoors and climbing. The ideal life for me is one that has a lot of purposeful work and a lot of adventures in the outdoor. Having this realisation alone on what my ideal life looks like makes me excited to see where I end up in the coming months.

For now the travel continues while I work in my down time of climbing.
