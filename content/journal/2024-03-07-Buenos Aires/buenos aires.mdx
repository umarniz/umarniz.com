It had been hard leaving Bariloche and Patagonia. Having made friends in the area who also like climbing I found myself naturally gravitating again and again to the city. In parallel my restlessness to start living my ideal life instead of thinking about my ideal life grows. The ideal life where I get to work a lot on purpose driven ventures like I always have and next to it have great access to nature for my mountain and climbing adventures. It is very easy to be lost in thought and at a certain points it is important to just do.

Knowing that someone I had met earlier was in Buenos Aires, I decided to fly out of Bariloche to come here for a few days. Taking refuge in this city of 15 million people. Having mostly been in mountains the last few months, it was a shock to see how many people are there in cities. Thousands of people waiting outside an arena for a Luis Miguel show. Cars honking and buses overflowing with people. What a contrast from Piedra Parada where on the main road you see a car an hour passing by.

I take refuge in the big city and for the first time open my laptop in months. Figuring out what I want to do next, I spend hours each day researching interesting problems to solve and meeting people in my network who need problem solvers.

As I walked around after a day behind the computer, my eyes watering from all the screen time they are not used to, I canâ€™t help but admire the beauty of cities in all their chaos.

A hodgepodge of cultures clashing together with inspirations on every corner for those who dare to look beyond the mundane. The homeless with a ripped nirvana t-shirt has a lot to make you wonder if you are not stuck in the egotistic cycle of survival we get swallowed into with day to day life. Where was he last night in the rain when you were having a cozy dinner? Why is he shouting? Is having those too unfortunate to have hygienic food a natural order we have to accept? In many cities today it is hard to be truly hungry with the amount of food thrown away. Hunger without a chance of food is different than hunger without the right choice of food. Or so I would imagine from my privileged outlook of a well rested mind never having truly experienced either of those hungers, exploring questions of human misfortune.

For now a week this beautiful city, rich of culture with incredibly friendly and beautiful people has been very kind to me. As I sit in the bus heading out of Buenos Aires, I notice my head is buzzing with ideas, ambitions and an urge to start building. I am happy to sense this as this is who I have always felt and the spirit I know of building is not lost in a few months of the sabbatical but has just subdued itself to spare room for self discovery. With no intention of immediately going full time back into work, I am looking forward to where this leads in the coming months.
