Since Rakaposhi everything feels like a drag. Since coming down I feel emotionally and physically exhausted but more importantly I feel quite done with my sabbatical. I have learnt profound lessons about my self, my future and the world around me.

As I continue the journey I change pace to enjoying the mountain workout while I can. I sprinted up and down Rakaposhi base camp in 4.5 hours (~20KM - 1500m up and down) I have been trying to find other speed hikes to train myself. This has resulted in hiking everyday for a few hours on elevations ranging from 2000m-4000m as a nice training

I feel I am ready to end this sabbatical and am eager to have a more sustainable life where my passion for work and outdoors can go together hand in hand.
